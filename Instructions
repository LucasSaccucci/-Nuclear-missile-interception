Hello,

The file MissileInterceptionAnimation.py corresponds to the file that was given to us.
The file scipy.optimize contain the ajustement program using the scipy.otimize.curve_fit() method.

Instructions :
- put values for the initials parameters of the missile (x0, y0, vx0, vy0)
- press the "add missile" button to initiate a new projectile with thoses parameters
- press the "Go" button to launch the animation
- press the "Measure" button the do a measurement :
  it will measure the position of the missile with a gaussian error
    (by default there will be a standard deviation of 20% of the distance to the lower left corner,
    but it can be change in the programme at the beginnig of the "_measure_position_()" function
    with the variable "standard_deviation" (after the comment "STAR" and just before the "Setting up of the canvas")
    
- after three measurment, the programme will start to fit the curve, and will draw the fitted curves and print the fitted parameters
- from that point, you will be able to press the "Launch" button in order to lauch the counter-measure
  and see how far is the real missile impact point from it predicted one.
  
  if the distance is less than 1000 (can be change in the "_lanch_missile()" function), it will print :
  "Stopped Missile, by : " and the distance (if d>1000 it will print "Missed missile")
  
- If the checkbox "Stop" is checked the annimation stopes while the button "Exit" will close the window
